# LocalMoneyTracker

LocalMoneyTracker is a desktop application for managing personal and family finances completely offline. It is built with Electron and stores data locally using SQLite (planned).

## Development

Install dependencies and start the application:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Currently the project contains only the basic Electron setup. Further development will implement features such as multi-currency accounts, budgeting, recurring transactions and data encryption.
